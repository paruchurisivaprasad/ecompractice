        <h1> virat kohli </h1>
        <p>
            A spunky, chubby teenager with gelled hair shot to fame after leading India to 
            glory in the Under-19 World Cup at Kuala Lumpur in early 2008. In an Indian team 
            filled with saint-like icons worthy of their own hagiographies, Virat Kohli, with his 
            most un-Indian, 'bad-boy' intensity, would clearly be an outcast.
